Pencil and Eraser 

Pencil: I'm sorry....

Eraser: For what? You didn't do anything wrong.

Pencil: I'm sorry because you get hurt because of me. Whenever I made a mistake, you're always there to erase it. But as you make my mistakes vanish, you lose a part of yourself. You get smaller and smaller each time.

Eraser: That's true. But I don't really mind. You see, I was made to do this. I was Made to help you whenever you do something wrong. Even though one day, I know I'll be gone and you'll replace me with a new one, I'm actually happy with my job. So please, stop worrying. I hate seeing you sad. :)

I found this conversation between the pencil and the eraser very inspirational. Leaders are like the eraser whereas their Followers are the pencil. They're always there for their followers, cleaning up their mistakes. Sometimes along the way... they get hurt, and become disengaged (older, and eventually pass on). Though their followers will eventually find someone new (Leader/Boss), but Leaders are still happy with what they do for their followers, and will always hate seeing their precious ones worrying, or sad.

This is for all Leaders out there.....

Comments of not Notes
----------------------
An old (but obviously not *too* old) saying I once heard: the beginner comments nothing, the novice comments how the code works, the journeyman comments how the tricky bits work, the master comments why he did it that way, and the guru comments why he *didn't* do it some *other* way.


Yet take Seth Godin’s definition of Leadership:
“The secret of leadership is simple: Do what you believe in. Paint a picture of the future. Go there. People will follow”
